# HashTree
## Abstract
#### "The only thing that grows faster than computer performance is expectation" - Bjarne Stroustrup. By standard, we learn about this new method of structuring data so fast that in fact, it beats all on average. Although, while on average it performs really fast on search time, it has a downside on it's absolute worse case performance. This data structure is called a Hash Map, it has a average time complexity of O(1) search and worse case time complexity of O(n) (space is O(n)). On average, it performs amazingly
