# HashTree
## Abstract
#### "The only thing that grows faster than computer performance is expectation" - Bjarne Stroustrup. By standard, we learn about this new method of structuring data so fast that in fact, it beats all on average. Although, while on average it performs really fast on it's find, insert, and remove operations, it has a downside on it's absolute worse case performance. This data structure is called a Hash Map, it has a average time complexity of O(1) and worse case time complexity of O(n) (space is O(n)). On average, it performs amazingly but on the worse case, performs really bad compared to other modern data stuctures which can cost time for efficient implemetations, but what if we could fix that. The traditonal HashTable performs O(n) worst case on open addressing (probing) collision resolution, as well as seperate chaining using a linked list. Although, we know linked list arent as effeicnet compared to other data stuctures, so what if we changed it up, say using a balanced tree instead. What if on average, we got O(1) performance from the hashing the hash map data strcuture provides while on the worse possible case of a collision, we resolve it by using a balanced tree, more specific an AVL Tree to get a guarretneed O(logn) worse case time complixty on the find, insert, and remove operations.
